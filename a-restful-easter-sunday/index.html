<p>Sounds like a job for Zapier! We use Zapier for a few things already, and it can indeed trigger on new timesheet entries from Harvest.</p><p>Well, after 8.5 hours, I have something that 'works'! IU</p><p>Here is the process:</p><p>Step 1: Upon trigger by Zapier detecting a new Harvest time sheet entry, it pulls the data of that entry.</p><p>Step 2: Using a custom GET webhook, Zapier queries Asana and looks for TASKS MODIFIED during the time period of the TIME SHEET ENTRY in the PROJECT that matches the ASANA PROJECT ID that you manually input once in the NOTES field of the HARVEST PROJECT.</p><p>Step 3: Take the tasks returned and clean up the formatting a little bit, adding a space after each one (already separated by commas).</p><p>Step 4: Using a custom PUT webhook request, UPDATE the NOTES of the HARVEST TIME SHEET ENTRY to be the ORIGINAL NOTE FROM STEP 1 + 'Asana tasks modified during this work period:' + FORMATTED ASANA TASKS FROM STEP 3.</p><p>So, as long as one manually inputs the Asana project ID of each project into the notes field of each Harvest project, this one Zap will automatically import the names of tasks modified during the work period, which is pretty sweet.</p><p>To do list:</p><p>What happens if you submit a time sheet entry after the fact? Can this script accomodate that? Should we just include all Asana tasks modified during that day?</p><p>Can one Zap do this for each user? Currently, this requires each user to have their own Harvest integration. I might be able to do it with a cusom webhook in step 1 instead of Zapier's standard Harvest module.</p><p>I'm having a major problem where I can't use Zapier to successfully request a list of all Harvest projects - my goal was to avoid the manual input of the Project ID by just having Harvest compare the project names in Asana and Harvest, but until/unless I can get that to cooperate, it's a non-starter.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">Tech Ambassadors</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
